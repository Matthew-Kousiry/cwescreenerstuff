	looking through ghidra and gef shows that the actual input is 0x14 away from target. and since target is also 4 bytes, we need to overwrite it with what its initialized to, which is 0xcaf3baee. using the python exploit in this folder, you can drop the exploit into the input and get the shell
just do it!
	looking at the program in ghidra, we can see the main function reads in buffer for the flag and comapres it to a preset password. The password is 8 chars long and is visible in the binary. Looking at the seperation between the input var and the output message there is a difference by 20 bytes. setting up the usual exploit will print the flag using the buffer as a path to the output. The address in the exploit is found by finding the address for opening the file in the binary.
